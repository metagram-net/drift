/*
Set up the Drift framework requirements. Naturally, this first migration is
going to break a few rules ;)

First, this includes a drift:no-transaction directive, which tells Drift to
skip two steps it would normally take:
1. Opening a transaction around the migration file. In Postgres, DDL can be
   done in a transaction. This can make some migrations safer, so Drift assumes
   transactions as the default.
2. Calling _drift_claim_migration(id, slug) before running the file. Since this
   claim would fail on a duplicate ID, this ensures we never run a migration
   twice (since it's normally part of a transaction).

It doesn't make sense to call _drift_claim_migration yet, because this is the
migration that defines it!

You can modify the _drift_claim_migration function if you want to. The only
expectation Drift has of it (besides the signature) is that it writes the
migration ID to the table and fails if that ID is already recorded.

You can also modify _drift_require_migration; Drift doesn't use it. It's useful
to call within a migration when it would only make sense to run after some
earlier one has completed.

You can also modify the schema_migrations table, but (at least for now) Drift
assumes that the migration records table has exactly that name and has the
integer primary key id column.
